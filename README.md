# Machine Learning Lifecycle with TensorFlow

This repository is part of a collaborative student project for our university course in **Machine Learning**. It provides a complete walkthrough of the **machine learning lifecycle** using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), including everything from data preparation to model evaluation and saving.


## Contents

- **ML_TF_notebook.ipynb**  
  A detailed, beginner-friendly Jupyter Notebook guiding through:
  - Data loading & preprocessing
  - Creating TFRecords
  - Building a basic CNN model
  - Using a pretrained ResNet
  - Model saving, loading & evaluation

- **images/**  
  Sample images used for training and testing.

---

## Goals

- Demonstrate the complete ML pipeline using real code
- Provide a well-documented, reproducible example project
- Support fellow students in learning TensorFlow basics
- Serve as a presentation guide during our class

---

## Technologies

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- Python â‰¥ 3.8  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
